# Wordle Solver

A solver for the popular [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) game written in Rust. It does not attempt to
be the most efficient solver possible but tries to avoid using obscure words. The aim is to produce more "human"
solutions.

The solver plays in hard mode, i.e. any revealed information must be used in subsequent guesses. It is able to solve
most but not all wordles in 6 guesses or fewer.

To try out the interactive solver run:

```shell
cargo run
```

To check the performance of the algorithm (in terms of guesses needed) run:

```shell
cargo run --bin bench-solver --release
```

The solver uses a frequency sorted list of words generated from the wordle 5-letter word dictionary and a general
purpose word frequency list. This generated file is part of the repository but if needed it can be regenerated by
running the following:

```shell
cargo run --bin generate-word-list
```
